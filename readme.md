This is a configuration, both in commandline and Jupyter-Notebook, of a program which uses a 
a file called 'credentials.json' to read the URL, username, and password of a BigFix server.

The sample notebook file shows it's use in a Jupyter-Notebook setting.

The intent is to use this as a configuration/query step in generating pretty graphs from within R & Zeppelin
notebooks, and eventually, shiny apps.
